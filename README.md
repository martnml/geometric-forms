# Geometric Shapes Printer

## Introduction
This Java program is designed for printing various geometric shapes, including rectangles, triangles, inversely inverted triangles, the letter Z, and validating the type of triangles based on provided specifications. The program provides a user-friendly interface to choose and print different shapes.

## Features
- **Rectangle Printer:** Allows the user to input height and width to print a rectangle made of asterisks.
- **Dent de S Printer:** Prints a series of denser triangles based on user input for repetition and width.
- **Triangle Printer:** Prints a right-angled triangle based on user-defined width.
- **Inversely Inverted Triangle Printer:** Prints an inversely inverted triangle based on user-defined width.
- **Letter Z Printer:** Prints the letter Z using asterisks with user-defined width.
- **Triangle Type Validator:** Validates and prints the type of a triangle based on user-provided side lengths (acute, obtuse, or right-angled).

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java file:
    ```bash
    javac Rectangle.java
    ```
2. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    java Rectangle
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the shape and provide necessary input.

## Shapes Available
1. **Rectangle**
